IFSE EAME Revit Standard
========================

IFSE stands for International Food Service and the addition Data Dictionary is given from the fact that it is done in 6 languages using the same GUID ([Global Unique Identifier](https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/GUID-global-unique-identifier)).

* In 2015 FCSI | Foodservice Consultants Society International EAME and EFCEM | European Federation of Catering Equipment Manufacturers created a BIM Taskforce to generate a document that covers World Wide requirements in the Foodservice Equipment Industry. They named this document IFSE Data Dictionary.

* In 2016 a World Wide Survey has been done from FCSI and it comes out that 83% of all BIM users are using [Autodesk® Revit®](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview) as Software, this is why they started working on a document based on Revit, even if they considered also other software that can use IFC format.

* Starting from the standards in use in USA for Revit they added additional parameters from the different Equipment Manufacturer.  By using the same GUID for several languages, it is possible to load the required language in the project and it will be represented in the schedule always at the right place, avoiding a miss match of columns with similar parameters.
